# synchronized-light-display

I put 7 strands of LEDs up around a coffee bar, and control them using an Arduino MEGA.
They can be controlled in three ways:
1) Through Vixen Lights to use them as a light show with music
2) Through the fade program in python to go through the colors
3) Through the [House Cup Website](https://github.com/micahkc/The-House-Cup) which has a color picking feature.
